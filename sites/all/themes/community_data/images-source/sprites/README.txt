Place the files for generating your sprites in subdirectories here. Each sprite
should have its components in a separate directory. The name of the directory
will be used to refer to the sprite in your Sass code.

For example, if you're creating a social networking icons sprite, your file
structure might look like:
  social/
    facebook.png
    twitter.png
    linkedin.png
