The meat of your project should go in this directory as logically named include
files (_{file-name}.scss).

This directory comes with a couple generic files, such as for holding variable
values. But you're encouraged to create as many files as you need to organize
your project successfully. Try to separate your files into logical groups of
code. For example, a project that defines a lot of basic layout and styling code
might have:
  _buttons.scss
  _colors.scss
  _forms.scss
  _navigation.scss
  _typography.scss
  etc.

Add your project-specific files to main.scss so they'll be imported automatically.
